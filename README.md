# Sinabro - Sequential Mutations Simulator
**Sinabro** (Korean: 시나브로) means "little by little unknowingly." The program will mutate a given coding sequence one-by-one until it mets given condition, and generates a sequence of sequences which I'll call a *trajectory*.

Import Sinabro as:
```python
Import sinabro as snbr
